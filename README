##About UPEC##

UPEC (Unique Program Execution Checking) is a formal approach for detecting vulnerabilities to transient execution attacks in out-of-order processors. This technique has been developed by the [Chair of Electronic Design Automation](https://www.eit.uni-kl.de/eis/research/) at RPTU Kaiserslautern, Germany.

A more detailed description of the employed formal verification technique can be found in:
